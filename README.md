This is the infrastructure for the TweetBot Podcast recommender that I build
for the Insight Data Project.

The project has been divided in the following directories:
analysis -> counting the languages of the project
api -> example notebook to connect to Listen Notes API
bot -> contains the bulk of the tweetbot infrastructire to perform LDA, TF-IDF
  		 and how to run from terminal (AWS)

lda -> LDA example notebook
nmf -> non-negative factorization Calculations notebook
sql -> PosGres SQL transoformation notebook
